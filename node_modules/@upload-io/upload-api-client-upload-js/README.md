# Upload API Client (Upload.js Edition)

**Client stubs for the Upload API.**

- A cut-down version of [`upload-api-client`](https://github.com/upload-io/upload-api-client) for [Upload.js](https://github.com/upload-js/upload-js).

- Only includes endpoints required by Upload.js.

- Uses XHR (to support widest range of browsers).

## Updating the stubs

Instructions for Upload Team developers:

1.  Pull latest `upload-io/upload` (in a working dir called `upload` next to this repository's working dir).

2.  Run `npm run generate` in this repository.

3.  **Manually remove irrelevant endpoints.** (We will automate this in future!)

4.  Follow `RELEASING.md` if there are changes.
